                    <p>Happy 2nd Year Friendship Anniversary my chuuu!
                        Can you believe it's been two years already since we talked 
                        that day shortly after Christmas? It's hard to believe that 
                        time goes by so quickly and before you know it days, weeks, months, 
                        and even years have passed my love!
                    </p>
                    <p>We've been through so many things the past few years baby.
                        I've seen myself grow and change and become a better man day 
                        by day, and I've seen how hard you've been working and studying 
                        and I'm proud of us baby! We've grown together and proven that even 
                        with the distance we've got what it takes to make it through baby. Not 
                        everyone can say that, but you and me? I know that no matter what life brings 
                        our way that we can do anything my love. We've got each other: I've got you, 
                        you've got me, and we both have the Lord Jesus Christ together. I love you so much 
                        more than you'll ever know, and I just want you to know: I'm proud of you 
                        my Gwapa Prinsesa!
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm looking forward to every memory that we'll have, every late night conversation,
                        every deep talk that we'll have, every picture that we'll send each other, every moment 
                        of life that we'll share, because every moment is beautiful with you my pretty pretty baby. 
                        I love you so much, thank you for being here by my side, I'll always be here to support you 
                        my one true love, my best friend, and my favorite person! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY BEAUTIFUL BINIBINI!
